//This is a story that everyone can edit
Once there was a frog hopping down the sidewalk, when he came across 
a large puddle.  Since it was such a hot day, he decided to jump into the 
puddle.
He did not see a rock inside the puddle and ended up injuring itself 
pretty badly.
He broke his leg and his neck. Even though he almost died, he did not give up because he was still single.
